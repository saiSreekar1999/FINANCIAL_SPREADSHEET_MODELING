Financial modeling involves creating a simplified representation of a real-world financial scenario to forecast a company's financial performance into the future.

### Model 1: Amortization Schedule

An amortization schedule is a detailed record of periodic payments on a loan, indicating how much of each payment goes towards the principal amount and how much towards interest until the loan is fully paid off at the end of its term.

### Key Elements of an Amortization Schedule in Financial Modeling

#### Loan Amount
This is the initial balance or the total amount borrowed for the loan or mortgage.

#### Term in Years
This defines the duration over which the loan will be repaid, typically expressed in years.

#### Interest Rate
This is the annual fixed rate applied to the loan, determining how much extra will be paid in addition to the principal balance over the life of the loan.

#### Payment Per Period
Each payment made is a combination of both principal and interest. Initially, payments are predominantly interest, with a shift towards principal in the latter part of the schedule.

#### Total Interest
This is the cumulative amount of interest paid over the loanâ€™s duration, assuming no additional principal payments are made.

#### Total Payments
The aggregate of all payments made over the lifetime of the loan, which includes both principal and interest, assuming there are no prepayments. 

This model allows borrowers to see how each payment affects their loan balance over time, helping in budgeting and planning for debt repayment.
